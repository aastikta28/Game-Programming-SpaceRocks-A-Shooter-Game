# Spacerocks-A-Shooter-Game
Used GIMP, Inkscape, Audacity, and Game Maker to produce a shooter game based on the classic, Asteroid. 

  The entire game has been built from the ground up. Illustrated the game background in GIMP, and created enemies, asteroids, and sprites in Inkscape. Then created retro sound effects and music in Audacity. Last, tied all the elements together in the free version of Game Maker Studio. In this project, I created game actions, applied physics to their assets, and did all the fine-tuning for the gameplay.
